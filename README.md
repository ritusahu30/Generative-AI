# Generative AI

This repository contains implementations and experiments related to generative artificial intelligence models. The goal is to explore various generative techniques, such as text generation, image synthesis, and more.

## Overview

Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content, including text, images, music, and more. This project showcases different models and frameworks used in the generative AI space, with examples of their applications.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Utilizing models like GPT-3 and other transformers for generating coherent text.
- **Image Generation**: Implementing GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to create realistic images from random noise.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Exploring methods for generating music or sound based on learned patterns.

## Projects

The following Jupyter Notebooks and scripts are included in this repository:

1. **GenAI_Task_1.ipynb**: 1. **GenAI_Task_1.ipynb**: Demonstrates downloading a YouTube video, extracting its audio, converting the audio to text, and then synthesizing the text into audio with a different voice.


## Requirements

To run the notebooks and scripts, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `torch` (or `tensorflow` depending on the models used)
- `transformers`
- `PIL` (for image processing)
- `librosa` (for audio processing)
- `playsound`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch transformers pillow librosa
